# Thoracic Surgery Dataset - Random Forest

### Introduction

- In this project, the problem that we will be investigating is binary classification. We will use numbers of different features (information) about patients to predict whether they will survive the first year after surgery.
- The data is dedicated to classification problem related to the post-operative life expectancy in the lung cancer patients after thoracic surgery in which there are two classes class 1 - the death of patients within one year after surgery and class 2 â€“ the patients who survive.


### Objective:

- Our objective is to Predicting whether a patient will survive the first year after lung cancer surgery - using machine learning.

### Tools:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib 
- Seaborn
- Sklearn

### Conclusion:

- We can able to achive our objectives.

### Notes:

- For more detailed explanation and implementation methods, please refer the ipynb file attached with this repository.
