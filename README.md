# Machine_Learning_Projects

### Introduction

- In this project, we will use the machine learning algorithms to predict the accuracy of the model.


### Objective:

- Our objective is to split the training and test dataset and fit the training dataset to the corresponding model and predict the target values.
- To find the accurracy of the model.

### Tools:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib 
- Seaborn
- Sklearn

### Conclusion:

- We can able to achive our objectives.
